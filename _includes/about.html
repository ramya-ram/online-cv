   I'm currently a Research Scientist at ASAPP, where I work on improving conversational AI systems. I completed my Ph.D. at MIT <a href="http://csail.mit.edu">CSAIL</a>, working with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/julie_a_shah/Welcome.html">Prof. Julie Shah</a> in the <a href="http://interactive.mit.edu">Interactive Robotics Group</a>. Some of my research interests are <b>human-in-the-loop machine learning</b>, <b>reinforcement learning</b>, and <b>AI safety</b>. My aim is to develop intelligent AI systems that can adapt and generalize through interaction with people. Towards this goal, I'm developing interpretable and interactive learning algorithms that can incorporate human feedback to improve transparency and learning in new environments.

   I received my M.S. at MIT in 2015. My work involved developing algorithms to enable effective human-robot team training. Prior to MIT, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>.
