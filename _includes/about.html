   I am a PhD candidate at MIT <a href="http://csail.mit.edu">CSAIL</a>. I work with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/julie_a_shah/Welcome.html">Prof. Julie Shah</a> in the <a href="http://interactive.mit.edu">Interactive Robotics Group</a>. My research interests include <b>reinforcement learning</b>, <b>interactive machine learning</b>, and <b>human-robot interaction</b>. My aim is to develop intelligent robots that can adapt and generalize through interaction with people. Towards this goal, we are developing interpretable and interactive learning algorithms that can incorporate human feedback to improve transparency and learning in new environments.

   I received my M.S. at MIT in 2015. My work involved developing algorithms to enable effective human-robot team training. Prior to MIT, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>.
